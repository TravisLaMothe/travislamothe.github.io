    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Something I find very interesting is watching <strong>speedrunning</strong> in video games. It fascinates me that there are people who will spend thousands of hours chasing a minor increase in their time in an attempt to beat the world record.
    
        A youtuber who documents speedruns, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SummoningSalt" title="Summoning Salt">Summoning Salt Youtube</a>, is an awesome resource for seeing all of the crazy tricks people use to beat games faster. One part that interests me the most is <strong>glitches</strong>. 
        
        Glitches in speedrunning are usually part of runs in the <strong>ANY %</strong> category. This category means beat the game as fast as possible using any glitches, tricks, or other way of gaining an adantage. People spend decades looking for glitches to make the speedruns faster.
